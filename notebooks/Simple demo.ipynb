    "# Simple Demo - Reviewing WEC Laptime Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For many forms of motorsport, timing data in the form of laptime data is often made available at the end of the race. This data can be used by fans and sports data journalists alike, as well as teams and drivers, for getting a *post hoc* insight into what actuall went on in a race.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Live laptime data is also typically provided via live timing screens, from which data feeds may be available to teams, although not, typically, to the public. (Data from timing screens can still be scraped unofficially, though...) Having access to laptime history during a race can be useful for reviewing how a race is evolving, plotting strategy, and even predicting likely future race events, such as overtaking possibilities or pit stops due to degrading laptimes.*\n",

    "The *pandas* package provides a handy `.plot()` method that allows us to plot charts directly from a dataframe. For example, we might want to plot lap time against lap number for each car.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original dataframe, lap times are given in the form `minute:second` (for example, `2:06.349`). To plot the laptimes, we need to convert this to a more convenient numeric form, such as the laptime given as a number of seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `utils` module we loaded in earlier contains a `getTime()` function that can perform this conversion for us. We can use a dataframe `.apply()` method to to apply that function to each value in the original `LAP_TIME` column and assign it to a new `LAP_TIME_S` column, before previewing a selection of the data frame where we select out those two columns, `LAP_TIME` and `LAP_TIME_S`:"
